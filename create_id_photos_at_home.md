## How to create digital ID photos and print them at home
### For digital photos only
1. On your phone, take a headshot picture with bigger background for later editing
2. Check the official requirements for photo sizes, 
    * [US passport photo](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html#:~:text=The%20correct%20size%20of%20a,the%20top%20of%20the%20head) requires 2x2 inches
    * [China visa photo](https://bio.visaforchina.org/SGP2_EN/generalinformation/news/282849.shtml#:~:text=It%20must%20be%20a%20color,of%20head%3A%2028mm%20to%2033mm.) requires 33mm by 48 mm
3. Use [PhotoRoom](https://www.photoroom.com/) to remove background, note that there will be a watermark at lower right corner <img width="743" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 9 18 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15622969/182981122-32cf64dc-66e5-4e1b-8dc6-222df0a98308.png">
4. Crop photo with any photo editor to cut the watermark
5. Use [Image Size](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-size/id670766542) to resize. Let's take the China visa photo as an example. Input the width we want as 33mm while the height as 48mm.<img width="539" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-04 at 9 19 36 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15622969/182981189-5da3e8a4-08f3-4947-96a4-49eda0495a1e.png">
6. Save it. 

### For printing paper photos
7. Use [Meitu](https://pc.meitu.com/) to do a collage, 4 reps of the photo to make a bigger (recommended square) photo for printing
8. Again use [Image Size](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-size/id670766542) to make sure the whole size is as desired. Still the China visa photo, say we did 4 reps. Now the width we want is 33x2=66mm while the height we want is 48x2=96mm. Input those numbers to Image Size to get the right size.
9. Print in-app or save and print in Photos but choose paper size as 4x6 inches.

Voila!
