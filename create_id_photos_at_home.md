## How to create digital ID photos and print them at home

1. On your phone, take a headshot picture with bigger background for later editing
2. Check the official requirements for photo sizes, 
    * [US passport photo](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html#:~:text=The%20correct%20size%20of%20a,the%20top%20of%20the%20head) requires 2x2 inches
    * [China visa photo](https://bio.visaforchina.org/SGP2_EN/generalinformation/news/282849.shtml#:~:text=It%20must%20be%20a%20color,of%20head%3A%2028mm%20to%2033mm.) requires 33mm by 48 mm
3. Use [PhotoRoom](https://www.photoroom.com/) to remove background, note that there will be a watermark at lower right corner
4. Crop photo with any photo editor, resize to square to cut the watermark
5. Use [Meitu](https://pc.meitu.com/) to do a collage, 4 reps of the photo to make a bigger (recommended square) photo for printing
6. Use [Image Size](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-size/id670766542) to resize. Let's take the China visa photo as an example, say we did 4 reps. Now the width we want is 33x2=66mm while the height we want is 48x2=96mm. Input those numbers to Image Size to get the right size.

7. Print in-app or in Photos but choose paper size as 4x6 inches
